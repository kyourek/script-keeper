= Introduction =
ScriptKeeper is an HtmlHelper extension method that tracks registered scripts.

= Details =

Its main purpose is to be used in .NET MVC partial views in which scripts are
required. Normally, partial views that require scripts would have to have
their scripts included in the parent view so as not to include the script
each time the partial view is rendered.

When a script is registered with one of the ScriptKeeper's script groups, the
ScriptKeeper remembers the source of the script and will only render it once
when the Render method is called. That means a partial view that registers a
script can be rendered multiple times on the same page, and the required script
will only be included once.

The ScriptKeeper can also be used to register short inline scripts. These scripts
will be rendered in their own script tag when the Render method is called.

See the example MVC app called Keeper.OfScripts.Example in this solution for
more information.
